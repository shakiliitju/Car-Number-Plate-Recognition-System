## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+** installed on your system
2. **Tesseract OCR** installed:
   - **Windows**: Download from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`
   - **macOS**: `brew install tesseract`

### Setup

1. **Clone or download the project**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shakiliitju/Car-Number-Plate-Recognition-System.git
   cd Car-Number-Plate-Recognition-System
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Linux/macOS
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Verify Tesseract installation**:
   ```bash
   tesseract --version
   ```

   **Note**: If you encounter "tesseract not found" error on Windows, you may need to add Tesseract to your system PATH or update the `app.py` file with the correct Tesseract executable path.

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your web browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

3. **Upload an image** containing a vehicle with visible license plate

4. **View results** including:
   - Detected license plate number
   - Confidence level
   - Processing steps information

### Supported Image Formats

- PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF
- Maximum file size: 16MB
- Recommended: Clear images with visible license plates

### Test Images

The project includes a comprehensive set of test images in the `test images/` folder with various vehicle types and license plate formats. These images can be used to test the system's accuracy and performance across different scenarios.

## Technical Details

### Image Processing Pipeline

1. **Image Resizing**: Large images are resized for optimal processing speed
2. **Grayscale Conversion**: Converts color images to grayscale
3. **Noise Reduction**: Applies Gaussian blur to reduce image noise
4. **Adaptive Thresholding**: Creates binary images for better text detection
5. **Morphological Operations**: Cleans up the binary image

### License Plate Detection Methods

1. **Haar Cascade Classification**: Uses pre-trained cascades when available
2. **Edge Detection**: Canny edge detection followed by contour analysis
3. **Aspect Ratio Filtering**: Filters contours based on typical license plate dimensions

### OCR Configuration

- Uses Tesseract OCR with multiple PSM (Page Segmentation Mode) configurations
- Character whitelist for alphanumeric characters only
- Multiple attempts with different configurations for better accuracy

### Pattern Validation

Supports various license plate formats:
- XX00XX0000 (2 letters, 2 numbers, 2 letters, 4 numbers)
- XXX000 (3 letters, 3 numbers)
- XXX0000 (3 letters, 4 numbers)
- 000XXX (3 numbers, 3 letters)

- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for various image types and qualities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tesseract not found error**:
   - Ensure Tesseract OCR is properly installed
   - Add Tesseract to your system PATH

2. **Poor recognition accuracy**:
   - Use high-quality, well-lit images
   - Ensure license plate is clearly visible and not obscured
   - Try images with minimal skew or rotation

3. **No license plate detected**:
   - Check if the license plate is clearly visible in the image
   - Try images with better contrast between plate and background
   - Ensure the license plate takes up a reasonable portion of the image

### Improving Accuracy

- Use images with good lighting conditions
- Ensure license plates are not tilted or skewed
- Clean license plates work better than dirty or damaged ones
- Higher resolution images generally provide better results

## ðŸ§° Debugging & Saved Uploads

When you upload an image the application saves a small set of debugging artifacts to help diagnose detection and OCR issues. This makes it much easier to inspect what the pipeline actually saw when Tesseract produced a wrong result.

- Location: `uploads/` (a new session folder is created for each upload)
- Folder naming: `Car Number-1`, `Car Number-2`, ... (sequential). If folder creation fails the app falls back to a UUID-named folder.

Files saved per session (summary):
- The original uploaded image (same filename you uploaded)
- `plate.png` â€” cropped plate region detected by the pipeline (if any)
- Detection images:
   - `sobel_combined.png` â€” combined Sobel edge map used for detection
   - `candidates_annotated.png` â€” annotated image showing all detection candidates and scores
   - `candidate_best_<score>.png` â€” cropped image of the top-scoring candidate
- Preprocessing images (one file each):
   - `bilateral.png`
   - `inverted.png`
   - `simple_otsu.png`
   - `morphological.png`

Notes:
- The system intentionally does NOT save OCR text output files (no `.txt` files are stored) to reduce persisted sensitive text.
- If a particular preprocessing method didn't produce a usable image it will be omitted from the session folder.

How to change or disable saving
- To change the uploads root folder, edit `app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER']` in `app.py`.
- To stop saving debug artifacts, remove or comment out the lines in `app.py` that set `recognizer.debug_dir = session_dir` and the image-write sections inside the recognizer methods. The code is centralized so this is quick to toggle.
- If you prefer UUID folders instead of sequential `Car Number-N` folders, change the upload handler to use `uuid.uuid4().hex` for folder names (the code already falls back to this on error).

Privacy and cleanup
- The `uploads/` folder can grow over time. Periodically remove old `Car Number-*` folders or add a small cleanup script to keep recent N sessions.
- Avoid storing images from production with sensitive personal data for longer than necessary; implement a retention policy if deploying this system in production.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for multiple license plates in a single image
- Real-time video processing capabilities
- Integration with databases for vehicle tracking
- Support for more international license plate formats
- Machine learning models for improved detection accuracy
