2. **Edge Detection**: Canny edge detection followed by contour analysis
3. **Aspect Ratio Filtering**: Filters contours based on typical license plate dimensions

### OCR Configuration

- Uses Tesseract OCR with multiple PSM (Page Segmentation Mode) configurations
- Character whitelist for alphanumeric characters only
- Multiple attempts with different configurations for better accuracy

### Pattern Validation

Supports various license plate formats:
- XX00XX0000 (2 letters, 2 numbers, 2 letters, 4 numbers)
- XXX000 (3 letters, 3 numbers)
- XXX0000 (3 letters, 4 numbers)
- 000XXX (3 numbers, 3 letters)
- And many more regional variations

## Applications

This ACNPR system can be used in various scenarios:

- **Traffic Management**: Monitor and track vehicles in traffic systems
- **Toll Collection**: Automated toll collection based on license plate recognition
- **Parking Automation**: Automatic entry/exit control in parking facilities
- **Law Enforcement**: Vehicle tracking and monitoring for security purposes
- **Access Control**: Restricted area access based on vehicle identification
- **Fleet Management**: Track company vehicles and logistics

## Performance Optimization

- **Image Resizing**: Automatically resizes large images for faster processing
- **Multi-method Detection**: Uses multiple detection algorithms for better accuracy
- **Efficient OCR**: Optimized OCR configurations for license plate text
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for various image types and qualities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tesseract not found error**:
   - Ensure Tesseract OCR is properly installed
   - Add Tesseract to your system PATH

2. **Poor recognition accuracy**:
   - Use high-quality, well-lit images
   - Ensure license plate is clearly visible and not obscured
   - Try images with minimal skew or rotation

3. **No license plate detected**:
   - Check if the license plate is clearly visible in the image
   - Try images with better contrast between plate and background
   - Ensure the license plate takes up a reasonable portion of the image

### Improving Accuracy

- Use images with good lighting conditions
- Ensure license plates are not tilted or skewed
- Clean license plates work better than dirty or damaged ones
- Higher resolution images generally provide better results
